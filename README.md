Introduction
Student Performance Prediction and Analysis is a project designed to help educators and students by predicting final marks based on a variety of factors. It identifies subjects in which a student is weak and provides targeted learning resources using the Gemini API. The project also includes various visualization techniques to aid in understanding the data and results.

Features
Prediction of Final Marks: Uses machine learning models to predict students' final marks based on input data.
Identification of Weak Subjects: Analyzes performance data to identify subjects where the student needs improvement.
Learning Resources: Integrates with the Gemini API to provide relevant learning resources for weak subjects.
Visualization Techniques: Includes various graphs and charts to visualize performance data and prediction results.
