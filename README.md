# Student Performance Prediction and Analysis
![Landing Page](static/landing.png)

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting and analyzing student performance using various factors. It provides insights into student data trends and helps in making informed decisions to improve academic outcomes.

## Features

1. **Predict Final Marks**  
   Provides predictions for students' final marks based on the input data.

2. **Identify Weak Subjects**  
   Highlights weak subjects using Z-score analysis to pinpoint areas needing improvement.

3. **Suggest Learning Resources**  
   Recommends personalized learning resources for weak subjects using the Gemini API.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   Offers interactive charts and graphs for better understanding and analysis of student performance.
   
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project includes the following attributes:

- **gender**: Student's gender.
- **age**: Student's age.
- **address**: Student's living location (urban/rural).
- **parent_education**: Highest education level of parents.
- **travel_time**: Home to school travel time.
- **study_time**: Weekly study hours.
- **failures**: Number of past class failures.
- **extra_classes**: Whether the student takes extra classes (yes/no).
- **extra_curricular**: Whether the student participates in extra-curricular activities (yes/no).
- **internet_access**: Whether the student has internet access at home (yes/no).
- **health**: Student's health status rating.
- **absences**: Number of school absences.
- **linear_algebra_mark**: Score in Linear Algebra course.
- **eng_mechanics_mark**: Score in Engineering Mechanics course.
- **basic_elec_mark**: Score in Basics of Electronics and Electrical Engineering course.

## Methodology

### 1. Predictive Model Development
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: The dataset includes both academic and non-academic factors. Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering are performed. Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.
- **Final Features**: The dataset is structured with encoded categorical variables and numerical features for better model performance.

### 2. Training the Machine Learning Model
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: A Random Forest Regression model is trained using bootstrap sampling and feature sampling. The final prediction is obtained through aggregation, providing accurate and stable results.

### 3. Weak Subject Identification & Resource Recommendation
- **Weak Subject Identification**: Z-score analysis identifies weak subjects based on predicted marks. A predefined Z-score threshold is used for classification.
- **Resource Recommendation**: The Gemini API generates subject-specific resources like online courses, books, YouTube videos, and study techniques. Results are formatted in HTML for integration.

### 4. Web Application Development
- **Backend**: Built using Flask, with a Random Forest model for predictions and MySQL for data storage.
- **Frontend**: Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it displays predictions and integrates resource recommendations.

### 5. Routes and Functionalities
- **Home Route**: Renders the homepage.
- **Login & Register Routes**: Handles user authentication and registration securely.
- **Prediction Route**: Processes student data and predicts performance.
- **Result Route**: Displays structured prediction results, including weak subjects.
- **Generate Resources Route**: Provides personalized learning resources via the Gemini API.
- **Charts Route**: Displays interactive visualizations of student performance data.
